# Added roles 

I added roles into the multisig, it definitly has to be improved. The GOD role, is just for testing it gives all the right to ... god :p If your are admin you'r allow to propose new role, and allow to remove TX from the dataBase. basacly right now it just 
user mode : [!image](./images/userMode.JPG)
Admin and God mode :[!image](./images/adminMode.JPG)

The same to remove a tx from the database :

# Added a custom calldata 

I added a custom callData. You juste have to put the contract address that you want to call for exemple goerli testnet token (TST) : 0x7af963cF6D228E564e2A0aA0DdBF06210B38615D

You can add a mount if needed 💸.
Then add the function name (⚠️ case sensitive) with args, exemple mint(address,uint256)

Then propose and wait to the tx be signed by the members.
